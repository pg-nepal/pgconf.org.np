        PostgreSQL Conference Nepal is an ongoing initiative to bring together PostgreSQL professionals, enthusiasts, developers,
        decision-makers, and advocates from both Nepal and around the world. The most recent edition of the conference was held
        on May 5‚Äì6 at Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel, continuing the tradition of community-driven knowledge sharing and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the successful launch of the first-ever PostgreSQL Conference Nepal in May 2018, the event has steadily grown in scale and impact.
        Over the years, it has featured insightful talks and workshops from both internationally renowned PostgreSQL contributors and prominent
        local experts. The conference serves as a vital platform to discuss technical innovations, real-world use cases, and community building.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nepal‚Äôs growing presence in the global software development ecosystem‚Äîpowered by a talented pool of Nepali IT professionals‚Äîmakes it a natural
        hub for open-source technologies like PostgreSQL. The conference supports this momentum by promoting PostgreSQL as a first-choice database solution,
        encouraging its adoption across the government, private, and public sectors.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the code, PostgreSQL Conference Nepal is a space where technical, non-technical, and community discussions converge. Whether you‚Äôre
        a seasoned developer or just getting started, it‚Äôs an opportunity to connect, learn, and contribute.
