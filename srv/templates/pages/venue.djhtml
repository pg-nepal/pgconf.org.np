                Dhulikhel, Kavrepalanchok, Nepal
            </p>

            <p>
                Just like in previous years, the 2025 edition of the conference took place at <a href="https://ku.edu.np/" target="_blank">Kathmandu University</a> in Dhulikhel. The scenic town
                 of Dhulikhel‚Äîaround 30 kilometers southeast of Kathmandu‚Äîis renowned for its panoramic Himalayan views and rich cultural heritage.
            </p>

            <p>
                Participants enjoyed a full conference experience with access to talks, workshops, food, and accommodation. The KU campus, being one of the premier institutions in Nepal, provided
                 the perfect academic and natural setting for the event.

            <p>
                There are several ways to reach Kathmandu University (KU) from Tribhuwan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>
                    By Taxi: Taxis are readily available outside the airport terminal. You can hire a taxi for the entire journey to KU,
                    which will take around 1 hour and 30 minutes depending on the traffic. The fare for the taxi ride will vary depending on
                    the type of vehicle and the time of day.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    By Bus: There are several bus routes that connect TIA to Dhulikhel, where KU is located. From the airport, you can take a
                    bus to Kathmandu and then take another bus or a microbus to Dhulikhel. The journey by bus will take around 2 hours.
                </p></li>
                <li><p>
                    By Private Car: You can also hire a private car to take you directly from the airport to KU. This option is more convenient
                    and comfortable but it will be more expensive than taking a taxi or a bus.
                </p></li>
